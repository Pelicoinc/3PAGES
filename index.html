            <h2>Dog Food</h2>
            <p>Made with high-quality ingredients: While ensuring that your dog's food meets AAFCO standards is a good starting point for your research, when you're shopping for dog food, you can definitely dig deeper. "I personally prefer to only select companies that employ a full-time board-certified veterinary nutritionist on staff and don't just consult with one," says Texas-based integrative veterinary expert Dr. Hunter Finn. Veterinarian Dr. Shelly Zacharias, a vice-president of medical affairs for Gallant, also stresses that dog-food ingredients lists should name the exact type of meat included (instead of “meat” or “meat by-products”) and should not contain white flour, preservatives such as BHA or BHT, propylene glycol, or rendered fat.</p>
